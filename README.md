# Analisis dan Desain Perangkat Lunak

## Tools

The main tool used to create this presentations is [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). They have a fairly good dependency management system, hence installing LaTeX allows you to compile the source code while automatically downloads the required libraries.

However, most images are mostly generated by a third party tool. I strive to use free, downloadable, tools:

* Screen mockups: [Balsamiq Mockup](https://balsamiq.com/products/) - commercial
* Data Flow Diagram: [Dia](http://dia-installer.de) - open source
* Entity Relationship Diagrams: [Visual Paradigm Community Edition](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/solution/freeumltool) - free
* Finite State Machines: [Qfsm](http://qfsm.sourceforge.net/)
